# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe

A classic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, created to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic.  

This project closely follows a YouTube tutorial and doesn’t include major custom improvements — it was made purely to learn game development basics in JS.

## ✨ Features

- 🎮 Two-player mode — play as O or X on the same screen  
- 🏆 Winner detection — highlights winning row, column, or diagonal  
- 🔄 Restart button — instantly resets the game board  
- 🎨 Simple, clean UI with grid lines for clarity  
- ⏱ Instant response — no reloads required  
- 📜 Turn-based play — automatically switches between players  

## 📂 Project Structure

```

tic-tac-toe/
├── index.html   # Game layout

└── index.js     # Game logic (player turns, winner check, restart)

```

## 🚀 Installation / Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.  
3. Click on any tile to make your move — game alternates between O and X.
